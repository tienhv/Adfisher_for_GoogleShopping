    Run an experiment.

    make_unit   -- Function that return a unit given a unit_id number (int).  
                   To keep the units exechangable, the unit_id should only be used as a label in logging.
    treatments  -- List of functions each of which that takes a unit and does some treatment to it.
    measurement -- A function that takes a unit and makes some measurements of it.
                   Should log the results.
    end_unit    -- A function that takes a unit and cleans it up.
    load_results-- Load the results from a log file into a pair vectors:
                    (1) one for each unit's response value
                (2) one for the treatment assigned to each unit
               with the units in the same order.
    test_stat   -- Takes a pair of vectors as above and computes a number.
    ml_analysis -- Should machine learning be used for the analysis?
    num_blocks  -- Number of blocks (rounds) used in the experiment.
    num_units   -- Number of units in each block.  
                       num_blocks * num_units is the sample size.
    timeout     -- How long to wait before giving up on a unit.
        log_file    -- File in which to store measurement and other helpful messages.  measurement should print to it.
    treatment_names -- names of the treatments in the list treatments in the same order.  
                           Optionally makes logs look better.
    
    For each block, do_experiment 
         (1) creates num_units units with make_unit,
         (2) subjects each of them to a function in treatments at random,
         (3) calls measurement on each of them to record some response, and
		 (4) calls end_unit on each of them.
    After doing this for every block, 
        it uses test_stat to run a permutation test on the results using that as the test statistic.
